# Overview

Nonsense plugin to activate `power mode` in Logseq. Keep typing if not the combo chain breaks. But if you don't stop to think, you will be rewarded by the Norse God, Thor.

# Usage

After installing, head to the plugin settings to set the parameters. You can:

- Define the combo multiples that would trigger Thor's reward.
- Define the cooling off period before your chain breaks, or in other words, how much time you have to think while typing.

When done, go back to your pages, and click `Power Mode` to turn it on. Have fun!

# Installation

If not available in the marketplace, download the latest release and manually load it into Logseq.
